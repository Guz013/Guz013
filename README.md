Software engineer based on Brazil since I learned that Java in "Minecraft: Java
Edition" was a programming language and not just a random fancy word, utilizing
said language to create my own game engine and diving more and more into the
tech world as time passed. Now, after 4 years, looking out for roles in
Full-stack development and/or DevTools/CLI tools development with
JavaScript/TypeScript, Go[^1] or Rust[^2]. And, in the free time, working on
open-source projects and organizations such as
[Lored](https://github.com/LoredDev) and [Capytal
Code](https://github.com/capytalcode). Visit my website for [more
info](https://guz.one/about) and to see [all the
projects](https://guz.one/projects).
